                        Motorsport is for me an important part of human history because it is a mix between our ability to innovate and create new and crazy technology and our ability to give everything physically and mentally to achieve our goals.

                        Motorsport is thousands of stories of record breaking challenges in different fields but it is also strong emotions like any sport but amplified by hundreds of horses any action becomes more risky than elsewhere therefore any success is more beautiful and any failure is much more painful.
